### Questions of interest
1. Which states have received the highest and lowest median ratings?
2. Is there a difference in purchases between gender and/or average age?
3. Which products are purchased more often each month?

### Importance
This is *especially* **important** because
 1. By knowing which states will both the highest and lowest median rating it will determine which states may need more promotions.

## Data Description
In order to access the data you must download the "shopping_trends_updated.csv" file from Kaggle. After you download the file, open Tableau Desktop application and connect the csv file. The "shopping_trends_updated.csv" dataset consists of 18 columns with different demographic, geographic, and sales information. The columns I used within this project were [Age(average), Gender, Purchase Amount(total), Review Rating(median), Items Purchased, and Season]. 

## Interpreting Visualizations
Visualization 1 - By creating this visualization I have found the locations that have the highest/lowest review ratings in order to improve service.
High: Wisconsin and Maine with median=4
Low: West Virginia and New Hampshire with median=3.5

Visualization 2 - This visualization shows us how the average age that purchased each item differs by gender.
There is no significant difference of the average ages by gender and item purchased. 
Max = ~7(boots) 
Min = 0.004(pants)

Visualization 3 - This visualization tells us which items were essentially purchased more per season.
In the Fall the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,224 (hats)
In the Spring the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,145 (sweaters)
In the Summer the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,006 (jewelry)
In the Winter the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,105 (shirt)
