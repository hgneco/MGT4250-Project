## Data Description


## Interpreting Visualizations
Visualization 1 - By creating this visualization I have found the locations that have the highest/lowest review ratings in order to improve service.
High: Wisconsin and Maine with median=4
Low: West Virginia and New Hampshire with median=3.5

Visualization 2 - This visualization shows us how the average age that purchased each item differs by gender.
There is no significant difference of the average ages by gender and item purchased. 
Max = ~7(boots) 
Min = 0.004(pants)

Visualization 3 - This visualization tells us which items were essentially purchased more per season.
In the Fall the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,224 (hats)
In the Spring the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,145 (sweaters)
In the Summer the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,006 (jewelry)
In the Winter the item that generated the highest purchase total = $3,105 (shirt)
